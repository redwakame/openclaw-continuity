# V2 Validation Summary

This summary consolidates the baseline validation evidence for the current V2 public mainline.

## Validation layers

### 1. Arbiter validation

- local validation run completed successfully
- result: `6/6 pass`

Validated:

- task hook beats proactive/rhythm
- rest suppress blocks dialog-style proactive sources
- operational/source-query does not reset the absence anchor
- proactive can win when no higher-priority source exists
- proactive beats rhythm when both are eligible
- cron/info yields according to the current collision strategy

### 2. Topic / summary validation

- local validation run completed successfully
- result: `4/4 pass`

Validated:

- task-like recent windows get a real topic label
- emotional/open-thread windows get a meaningful continuity summary
- weak windows fall back to light continuity instead of fake specificity
- trace/debug output is readable

### 3. Writeback validation

- local validation run completed successfully
- result: `4/4 pass`

Validated:

- proactive dispatch does not automatically pollute daily memory
- watchful/open-thread paths defer writeback until stronger confirmation
- weak-context proactive follow-up does not write
- user return after proactive raises eligibility in a controlled way

### 4. Routine / phase validation

- local validation run completed successfully
- result: `7/7 pass`

Validated:

- structured `sleep / wake_window / active_day` phase switching
- sleep phase blocks general proactive behavior
- wake window opens the wake-seed path
- active-day phase re-enables ordinary cadence
- explicit early wake can override the expected wake point
- memory fallback still works when no formal schedule exists

### 5. Internal near-live validation

- local near-live validation run completed successfully
- result: `5/5 pass`

Validated:

- task-like follow-up is owned by the task/progress line
- open-thread proactive follow-up is natural and topic-aware
- work/dnd suppress pauses general proactive behavior and can be cleared naturally
- sleep/wake transitions work with wake-seed routing
- `/new` continuity and `new_session_carryover_applied` now stay aligned

## Residual risk level

Residual issues are currently assessed as **patch-level**, not structural:

- wording refinement
- phrase-list tuning
- cadence threshold tuning
- documentation polish

## Cleanliness check

The package was rechecked for:

- private test terms
- live workspace paths
- personal identifiers
- session id / TG id residue

No blocker-level public contamination remained after cleanup.

## What this summary does not replace

This summary is not the publication gate by itself.

Before release, also run the explicit matrix in [release-acceptance.md](release-acceptance.md), especially for:

- language neutrality
- timezone / generic-offset neutrality
- `/new` followed by bare `hi` / `嗨`
- host-addon sync when a bridge addon is installed
